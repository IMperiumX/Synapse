# Synapse: Real-time Collaborative Knowledge Base API

Synapse is a powerful, **backend-only** API that enables the creation of real-time, collaborative knowledge bases. It provides a robust foundation for teams to build, organize, and share knowledge efficiently.

**This project is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.**

## Core Features

* **Real-time Collaboration:**  Multiple users can edit the same page simultaneously, with changes reflected instantly for all collaborators. Powered by Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) - to be determined.
* **Markdown-Based Editing:**  Content is created and edited using the familiar and flexible Markdown syntax.
* **Hierarchical Structure:** Organize pages into spaces (like folders) to create a well-structured knowledge base.
* **Version Control:**  Track changes to pages over time with a built-in version history system.
* **Powerful Search:**  Quickly find the information you need with an integrated search engine (Elasticsearch planned).
* **Granular Access Control:** Manage permissions at the knowledge base, space, and page levels, controlling who can view and edit content.
* **RESTful API:**  Interact with the knowledge base programmatically through a well-documented RESTful API.
* **Authentication:** Secure API access with token-based authentication (JWT).

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
* **Real-time Communication:** Django Channels, WebSockets
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch (planned)
* **Caching:** Redis (planned)

## Project Goals

* **Scalable Real-time Collaboration:** Implementing robust and efficient conflict resolution for concurrent editing.
* **API Design:** Building a well-structured, documented, and maintainable RESTful API.
* **Data Modeling:**  Creating a flexible and performant database schema for a complex data structure.
* **Search Integration:** Leveraging the power of a dedicated search engine for fast and relevant results.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Implement Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDTs for real-time collaboration.
* [ ] Integrate Elasticsearch for full-text search.
* [ ] Implement robust user authentication and authorization.
* [ ] Generate API documentation (e.g., using drf-yasg).
* [ ] Implement caching with Redis.
* [ ] Add support for attachments.
* [ ] Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for basic interaction with the API (optional).

**Important Considerations**

* Add a `LICENSE` file to your project (MIT is a good choice for open-source projects).
* Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude things like your virtual environment, local settings files, and compiled Python files.
* As development progresses, keep your `README.md` up to date, add detailed documentation, and consider creating a contribution guide.
* Add a `requirements.txt` file that lists all of the project's dependencies.

This comprehensive README.md provides a professional overview of your project, outlines its core features and technical details, and guides potential contributors. The name "Synapse" should give your project a strong identity. Remember to tailor the README to reflect the actual state of your project as you continue development.
